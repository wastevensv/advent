These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) challenges for 2015. I'm attempting them in C. Because I don't know C very well and because I simply like the challenge.

**12/9 (Day 4)** I switched to Haskell for the next few challenges.
**12/10 (Day 5)** I switched to Perl for the this challenge.

**Naming convention:** day#-puzzle#
